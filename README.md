### 2. MLP for images:

In this notebook we are going to learn how to use a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) (Fully-Connected, Feed-Forward Network) for classifying images.

An MLP can be used with any kind of input data if we can represent it as a vector of real numbers. The shape of the input vector determines the size of the first layer in the model.

In the case of images (2D arrays of pixel values) we can get fixed-length vectors by: (1) using always images of the same size, and (2) flatenning the images into a 1D array. The flatten operation collapses an array into one dimension. For example, if we have a grayscale image of  28Ã—28  pixels, its flattened version is a 1d array of  784  pixel values. Now we can fed these  784  values into a MLP for classifiying the image.

## Assignments

### P3. Introduction to Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

In this assignment, you'll explore the fundamentals of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks using PyTorch for both classification and regression tasks. You'll also gain insights through visualizations and explanations of the network's behavior. The assignments can be run on Colab, enabling you to visualize the results effectively.

### P4. MLP for Images

This assignment introduces the use of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or Fully-Connected Feed-Forward Network for image classification. MLPs can handle various types of input data when represented as real-number vectors. In the case of images, the key is to flatten them into 1D arrays and use them as input to the MLP. This notebook focuses on classifying images using MLPs.
