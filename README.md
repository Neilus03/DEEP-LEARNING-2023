# DEEP-LEARNING-2023
A series of notebooks that constitute the coding assignments for Deep learning and Neural Networks subject in Artificial Intelligence degree (UAB).

## Assignments

### 1. Multilayer Perceptron 

Generate several Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks using PyTorch to perform classification and regression tasks, create visualizations, and gain insights into network behavior. Run it on Colab to visualize the results effectively.

| [Solved Notebook](https://github.com/Neilus03/DEEP-LEARNING-2023/blob/main/Solved_Notebooks/P3_Intro_MLP_Neil.ipynb) |

### 2. MLP for Images

Learn how to use a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) (Fully-Connected, Feed-Forward Network) for classifying images. An MLP can be used with any kind of input data if it can be represented as a vector of real numbers. In the case of images (2D arrays of pixel values), flatten the images into a 1D array to classify them effectively.
