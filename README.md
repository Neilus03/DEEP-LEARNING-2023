# DEEP-LEARNING-2023
A series of notebooks that constitute the coding assignments for Deep learning and Neural Networks subject in Artificial Intelligence degree (UAB).

## Professor and provider of notebooks:

Dimosthenis Karatzas.

## Assignments:

### 1. Multilayer perceptron:

Generate several multi layer perceptron neural networks using Pytorch to perform classification and regression, make visualizations and understand and explain what happens. Run it on colab to see al the visualizations.

### 2. MLP for images:

In this notebook we are going to learn how to use a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) (Fully-Connected, Feed-Forward Network) for classifying images.

An MLP can be used with any kind of input data if we can represent it as a vector of real numbers. The shape of the input vector determines the size of the first layer in the model.

In the case of images (2D arrays of pixel values) we can get fixed-length vectors by: (1) using always images of the same size, and (2) flatenning the images into a 1D array. The flatten operation collapses an array into one dimension. For example, if we have a grayscale image of  28Ã—28  pixels, its flattened version is a 1d array of  784  pixel values. Now we can fed these  784  values into a MLP for classifiying the image.
